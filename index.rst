=====================

Welcome! RobotPy is a project created by a community of FIRST mentors and
students dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics
Competition. This documentation site contains information about various projects
that RobotPy supports, including guides and API references.

Please read our :ref:`Upgrade Notes<upgrade_notes>` page for things that have
changed this season that you should be aware of.

.. note:: RobotPy is a community project and the tools we create are not
          officially supported by FIRST. Please see the
          :ref:`FAQ <faq>` for more information.

          We are working with the WPILib team to make Python an officially
          supported language in 2024. See https://wpilib.org/blog/bringing-python-to-frc for the announcement.

Projects
--------

The primary reason RobotPy exists is to support teams that want to write their
FRC robot code using Python, and we have several projects related to this:

* `robotpy-wpilib <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib>`_: the python implementation of WPILib for FRC
* `pyfrc <https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc>`_: provides unit testing, realtime robot simulation, and easy upload capabilities for your RobotPy code
* `roborio-packages <https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages>`_: Various python packages for the RoboRIO platform installable by opkg, including the python interpreter and numpy
* `robotpy-wpilib-utilities <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib-utilities>`_: Community focused extensions for WPILib

Additionally, RobotPy is home to several projects that are useful for all teams,
even if they aren’t writing their robot code in python:

* `pyntcore <https://github.com/robotpy/pyntcore>`_: python bindings for NetworkTables that you can use to communcate with a dashboard and/or your robot.
* `pynetworktables <https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables>`_: legacy NetworkTables implementation that you can use to communcate with SmartDashboard and/or your robot.
* `pynetconsole <https://github.com/robotpy/pynetconsole>`_: A simple netconsole implementation in python
* `robotpy-cscore <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-cscore>`_: Python bindings for cscore, a powerful camera/streaming library
* `robotpy-apriltag <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-apriltag>`_: Python bindings for the WPILib apriltag library
* `roborio-vm <https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-vm>`_: Scripts to create a QEMU virtual machine from the RoboRIO image file

There is a lot of good documentation, but there's still room for improvement.
We welcome contributions from all members of the FIRST community!
