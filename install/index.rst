Installation
============

Writing Robot code in Python:

* If you wish to deploy code or use the Robot Simulator, see the :ref:`computer
  Installation documentation <install_computer>`.

* To install RobotPy on your robot, see the :ref:`RobotPy installation
  documentation <install_robotpy>`.

Using NetworkTables from Python:

* To install pynetworktables on a system that does not have RobotPy
  or pyfrc installed on it (such as a coprocessor like the Raspberry Pi), see the
  :ref:`pynetworktables installation documentation <install_pynetworktables>`.

Using cscore from Python:

* See the :ref:`robotpy-cscore installation documentation <install_cscore>`.

Installing extra software packages on the RoboRIO:

* You can install third party packages such as OpenCV, NumPy, robotpy-cscore,
  robotpy-ctre, and other python packages on your RoboRIO using the :ref:`RobotPy
  Installer <install_packages>`.
